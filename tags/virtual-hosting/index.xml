&lt;div class="pageinfo pageinfo-primary">
&lt;p>We no longer provide support for static web page serving, PHP, and CGI
scripting. We realize that this might be an inconvenience to some.&lt;/p>
&lt;/div>
&lt;h2 id="temporary-hosting-using-a-vm">Temporary Hosting using a VM&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>For students doing project work, we can provide temporary virtual machines running on VMWare or Windows Hyper-V.
These VMs can be configured with a web server that is visible internally to Loyola.
See &lt;a href="../virtualization/">Virtualization&lt;/a> for additional information.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="alternatives">Alternatives&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>We encourage those who need to set up web sites to consider establishing
web hosting account via one of the many providers out there.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="blogging-platforms">Blogging platforms&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>If you are just looking to maintain a simple site that allows for page creation and blog posts, the best options are blogging platforms, such as &lt;a href="https://wordpress.com">Wordpress&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="https://ghost.org">Ghost&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="https://micro.blog">Micro.Blog&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="linode">Linode&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>We actually use dedicated virtual machines for some department hosting needs. A particularly nice option is &lt;a href="https://linode.com">Linode&lt;/a>. For as little as $5-$10 a month, you can get a dedicated virtual machine with any Linux distribution you like.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This option is primarily for more technical users who know Unix/Linux system administration (and commands).&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="google-apps">Google Apps&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>We do have Google Apps available in the department, which includes Blogger and Google Sites. While both of these options are starting to look/feel a bit dated, they nevertheless are easy to use and require virtually no configuration (except for us to enable your site).&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Docs: Virtualization</title><link>/docs/department-services/virtualization/</link><pubDate>Sat, 25 Dec 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/docs/department-services/virtualization/</guid><description>
&lt;p>We are now able to host Xen and Windows Hyper-V virtual servers in the
department. We can host these with a dedicated public IP address
(justification is required to obtain one) or private IP addresses which
would be visible when you connect via the Loyola VPN. Given our present
resource limitations, we can only provide virtual machines on a limited
basis, primarily for faculty and student research/outreach projects.
Please send your requests to the vm alias (see
&lt;code>getting-help&lt;/code>{.interpreted-text role=&amp;ldquo;doc&amp;rdquo;}) and make sure you include
the following information:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>name&lt;/strong>: your full name&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>university e-mail address&lt;/strong>: we will not give virtual machines to
anyone who is not part of the Loyola community, although we will
allow same to be used by outsiders, provided there is a Loyola
contact.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>alternate e-mail address&lt;/strong>: where we can find you in case you
decide not to read your Loyola e-mail (or you're not getting your
messages!)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>duration&lt;/strong>: amount of time in months for your project, or
permanent (in general, permanent machines will be given only with
highly sound justification.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>RAM&lt;/strong>: required RAM in 256MB increments; large allocations are
rarely given. We'll prioritize requests that are smaller than
512MB.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>disk space&lt;/strong>: required storage in 10GB increments&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>desired OS&lt;/strong>: We recommend Ubuntu server edition but can support
many others. At present, we do not support any OS that requires a
license key or activation (except Windows on our new Hyper-V racks).&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>desired hostname&lt;/strong>: may be requested in one cs, math, etl, cslabs
(a private zone), all of which are subdomains of luc.edu. For
example, if you want the hostname gkt in the domain etl.luc.edu, you
would ask for gkt.etl.luc.edu&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>public or private static IP&lt;/strong>: You must say public or private. We
will generally be asking you (especially if you're a student) to
start with a private IP address. This in most cases will require you
to choose the domain cslabs.luc.edu, which only resolves within
Loyola proper.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>type of virtual machine&lt;/strong>: Xen, VMware, Hyper-V program. You would
only need VMware if you want to host a Windows VM but we presently
have no plans to support Windows, per our emphasis on freely
available OS technology without activation requirements.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>number of CPUs&lt;/strong>: we are only able to support 1 for most requests
at this time.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul></description></item></channel></rss>
