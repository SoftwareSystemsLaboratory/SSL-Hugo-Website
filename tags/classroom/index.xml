&lt;h1 id="windows-labs">Windows Labs&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>With our partner, Loyola Information Technology Services (ITS), we
ensure that CS and Math/Stats software needs are formally requested from
ITS. This allows us to focus on advanced computing needs (in particular,
Linux and server-side applications) and ensure ubiquitous access to
Windows labs via the Loyola login ID.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Faculty may request additional software by visiting
&lt;a href="http://www.luc.edu/its/resources/technologypurchases/hardwaresoftwarereviewprocess/">ITS&lt;/a>,
or by sending an e-mail to the &lt;em>windows&lt;/em> alias (see
&lt;code>getting-help&lt;/code>{.interpreted-text role=&amp;ldquo;doc&amp;rdquo;}). In the latter case, the
lab manager (Miao Ye) will fill in a software request on your behalf.
You are encouraged to submit requests one month before the end of the
current term, if you need the software in the summer or following term.
For example, if you need software in Fall 2009, consider getting your
request in by April of 2008 (one month before the Spring 2008 term
ends). You should also indicate in your request whether you are willing
to help test the software after it becomes available. We cannot be held
responsible for late requests or requests that do not have a designated
faculty member interested in testing.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Again, because the Windows hardware and software are now maintained by
ITS, we ask that all issues you encounter be reported, no matter how
trivial. If you discover broken hardware and/or software, use the &lt;a href="http://www.luc.edu/helpdesk/">ITS
Help Desk&lt;/a>.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
