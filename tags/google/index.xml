&lt;p>The CS and Mathematics departments subscribe to Google Apps for Your
Domain. Among other things, we can host sites, e-mail, documents,
calendaring, etc. Our primary use at the moment is for Google Sites,
which allows individuals, workgroups (e.g. project teams in classes),
research groups, and other collaborations to host their own private or
public web sites. While this software is officially in beta, it's
already proving to be a winner for many needs. Moreover, we can assign
you your own hostname within one of the 3 domains. Examples include
&lt;a href="http://www.etl.luc.edu">www.etl.luc.edu&lt;/a>,
&lt;a href="http://gkt.etl.luc.edu">gkt.etl.luc.edu&lt;/a>,
&lt;a href="http://doty.math.luc.edu">doty.math.luc.edu&lt;/a>, and
&lt;a href="http://tonyg.math.luc.edu">tonyg.math.luc.edu&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We reserve the right to terminate any Google site that contains
inappropriate content or is reported to Google or us as being offensive.
So we ask that if you have such uses in mind to consider setting up your
own Google Site that is not connected to LUC or the department proper.
We are not generally taking advantage of e-mail and other services at
this time and reserve these address for faculty and researchers
officially connected to the department. To request a Google Site or
other service, please see &lt;code>getting-help&lt;/code>{.interpreted-text role=&amp;ldquo;doc&amp;rdquo;}.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
