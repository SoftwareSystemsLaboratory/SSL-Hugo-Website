&lt;p>Needs updates.&lt;/p>
&lt;/div>
&lt;p>We pride ourselves in paying attention to human interaction. While the
support aliases described in the previous section must be used whenever
you want something to be done, you may want to know something about the
major roles in our department that are applicable to computing.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Chairperson&lt;/strong>: &lt;a href="http://laufer.cs.luc.edu">Konstantin Läufer&lt;/a>.
Please contact the Chairperson with any suggestions you have for
improvement, especially when itcomes to computing matters. The
chairperson has the ultimate reponsibility for all department
matters, especially the departmental computing budget.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Computing Director&lt;/strong>: &lt;a href="http://thiruvathukal.com">George K.
Thiruvathukal&lt;/a>. Pleasecontact the
Computing Director with any suggestions you have for improvement or
with technical support questions. The Computing Director is
ultimatelyresponsible for the implementation of all computing
initiatives for the department, in particular those that support our
teaching and research missions.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Lab Manager&lt;/strong>: &lt;a href="http://www.luc.edu/cs/people/staff/yemiao.shtml">Miao
Ye&lt;/a>. The Lab
Manager is ultimately responsible for the implementation of the
intiaitives as defined by the Computing Director (who consults with
the Chairperson). Because there is onlyone Lab Manager at the
moment, it is important to recognize that he/she works to support
all requests in a timely manner but may not be ableto resolve your
problem immediately. Please allow 24-48 hours for a response to any
non-emergency need.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Computing Committee&lt;/strong>: &lt;a href="http://thiruvathukal.com">George K.
Thiruvathukal&lt;/a> (Computing Director and
Committee Chair), &lt;a href="http://laufer.cs.luc.edu">Konstantin Läufer&lt;/a>,
Prof. Stephen Doty, and two new members to be determined (one more
faculty and one more student member). The Compting Committee meets
at least twice per academic year and drafts recommendations and
resolutions for future computing initiatives that support the
department's teaching and researchmission and those of
collaborating departments. The commitee's proceedings are reported
to the Chairperson.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>In most cases, you should contact the &lt;strong>Lab Manager&lt;/strong>&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
