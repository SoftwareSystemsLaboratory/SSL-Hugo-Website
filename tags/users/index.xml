&lt;p>All students and faculty are given accounts in the CS department. Your
account is intended for your use only. Please change your intial
password immediately on first use to improve security. (We are able to
determine when a password has not been changed from the default and will
lock accounts after a certain period.)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We presently lack a self-service mechanism to the PAM service maintained
by ITS for resetting your password. In any event, given the manageable
number of users, you can send a request to the accounts alias to have
your password reset for you. Since we set up all of our accounts to
match your university login ID, it is our policy to send your
replacement password to your Loyola e-mail address. You may also opt to
meet the lab manager in person but must show your Loyola or a
government-issued id with your photo on it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To reset your password, you should log into &lt;code>random.cs.luc.edu&lt;/code> using a
secure shell client (a.k.a. SSH) and use the passwd program to reset it.
We recommend that you are on campus when you need to change your
password.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
