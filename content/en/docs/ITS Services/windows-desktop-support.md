Note: As of June 30, 2010, we no longer provide desktop computing
support in the department.
These needs are addressed by the ITS desktop
support group. 
This change does not prevent users from establishing their own standalone desktop setup but we are focusing our efforts on non-commodity needs that are synergistic with advanced teaching/research needs.

# Windows Desktop Support

Windows desktop matters are handled by ITS.
If you are experiencing trouble with Windows labs and other ITS issues, please open a support ticket at <https://luc.saasit.com/>.
Linux and Mac desktop matters are the responsibility of individual faculty.
