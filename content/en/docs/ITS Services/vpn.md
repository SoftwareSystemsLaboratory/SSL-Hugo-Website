 Getting started with the University VPN. 
---

There are a number of services (read: ports) that are firewalled because
they're not secure or under persistent threats from the outside.
The university VPN allows you to access these services.

There is a self-service portal via ITS at <https://luc.saasit.com/>.

We recommend that all students working on advanced projects to get access to the VPN so they will run into few(er) surprises.
