# IGnation and University Blogs/Wikis

The university provides a system called
[IGnation](http://ignation.luc.edu/), which supports wikis and blogs.
While many of our users typically take advantage of publicly available
sources, e.g. Blogger and Wordpress, we would like to encourage our
users to consider these university-maintained sources as a starting
point.

Should these not be appropriate for your needs, we can establish a
Google Site for you via `google-apps-cs`{.interpreted-text role="doc"}
for Your Domain (see below), which is a feature-rich solution for
maintaining public and private web sites, and (unlike the university
solution) can be used to collaborate with those outside of the
institution (as it is tied to e-mail addresses, not university IDs).
