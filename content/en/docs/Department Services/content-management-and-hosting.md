We no longer provide support for static web page serving, PHP, and CGI
scripting. We realize that this might be an inconvenience to some.

## Temporary Hosting using a VM

For students doing project work, we can provide temporary virtual machines running on VMWare or Windows Hyper-V.
These VMs can be configured with a web server that is visible internally to Loyola.

## Alternatives

We encourage those who need to set up web sites to consider establishing
web hosting account via one of the many providers out there.

### Blogging platforms

If you are just looking to maintain a simple site that allows for page creation and blog posts, the best options are blogging platforms, such as [Wordpress](https://wordpress.com), [Ghost](https://ghost.org), [Micro.Blog](https://micro.blog).

### Linode

We actually use dedicated virtual machines for some department hosting needs. A particularly nice option is [Linode](https://linode.com). For as little as \$5-\$10 a month, you can get a dedicated virtual machine with any Linux distribution you like.

This option is primarily for more technical users who know Unix/Linux system administration (and commands).

### Google Apps

We do have Google Apps available in the department, which includes Blogger and Google Sites. While both of these options are starting to look/feel a bit dated, they nevertheless are easy to use and require virtually no configuration (except for us to enable your site).
